# Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

This is a small open-source project. We expect contributors to:

- **Be respectful**: Disagree on technical points, but don't be a jerk about it
- **Be constructive**: Criticism is fine, but suggest improvements
- **Be patient**: Maintainers are volunteers with day jobs
- **Be honest**: If you break something, say so
- **Be collaborative**: We're all here to make this better

## What's Not Okay

Don't:

- Harass, insult, or attack other contributors
- Post spam or off-topic content
- Share others' private information without permission
- Use the issue tracker for support (use Discussions instead)
- Demand features or immediate responses

## Scope

This applies to:

- GitHub issues and pull requests
- Discussions and comments
- Project communication channels
- Representing the project in public spaces

## Enforcement

If someone's being a problem:

1. Maintainers will issue a warning
2. Repeated issues: temporary ban
3. Serious violations: permanent ban

We're pretty laid back. Just don't be intentionally difficult.

## Reporting

If you see a problem, email the maintainers or flag the content on GitHub.

We'll review and respond within a few days.

## Attribution

This is based on common open-source codes of conduct but simplified for a small project.

tl;dr: Be nice, be helpful, don't waste people's time.
